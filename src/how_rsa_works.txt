OK  here is how RSA works

Message: HELLO
Public: encryption:  keys = (5, 14)
Private: Decryption: keys = (11, 14)

Lets say that HELLO encodes to the number 2 somehow (math)

( Message ^ 5 ) mod 14 = 4       4 = encrypted message

( 4 ^ 11 ) mod 14 = 2       2 = decrypted message

so how are (5, 14) realted to (11, 14) ?


pick two prime numbers: 2, 7
p = 2
q = 7

n = p*q = 14

now make a list between 1 and 14 and remove the common factors, the length of that list is 6
the easy way to get L = 6 is

L = (q-1)*(p-1) = 6 = L


now we get to pick the enxryption key
in the example it was (5, 14) and we know that 14 is the modulus = n

the enctyption key must be between 1 and L = 6
so that cuts it to [2, 3, 4, 5]

It also has to be coprime with L=6 and the modulus=n=14, so the answer has to be 5 in this case

So now we have (5, 14) = (e, n)

Now onto the decryption part, how did we pick (11, 14)
14 is the modulus but where is 11 from?

lets call 11 d, 11 = d

d has to follow one rule:
(d*e) mod (L) = 1
so D can be any number of those numbers that fits the conditions


so symbolically

MESSAGE: m
public_key: (e, n)
private_key: (d, n)

ciphertext = c = (m^e) mod n

m = (c^d) mod n
(d*e) mod L = 1
L = (p-1)(q-1)
n = pq
